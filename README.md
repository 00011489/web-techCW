I have created this website using my html, css and javascript skills. This website is the portfolio-website of imagined character Benjamin Wallaca who is full-stack software engineer. Clean and nice web portfolio, fully developed mobile first and responsive, for a designer or developer. It includes a Header, Home, About, Qualification, Services, Project in mind, Portfolio, Testimonial, Contact and Footer. And web animations in the home part. My website contains hamburger menu, validation form and other interactive things. My website is fully responsive, for mobile phone screens and desktops. For mobile screens, I used hamburger menu in the place of navigation bar. I also make it available to user to download pdf file.
